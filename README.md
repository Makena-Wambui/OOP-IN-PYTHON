OOP is a way of organizing and writing code which makes it easier to understand and reuse

Object is a block of code with own properties(attributes) and functions(methods)

Objects are like building blocks that can be used to create more complex programs

Encapsulation - hiding internal details of objects from the outside, making it easier to manage and understand code

Think of classes as blue prints

Inheritance allows for the creation of classes that can create multiple objects with shared properties and methods

Each object has its own properties/attributes and actions/methods hence allowing them to look different and do different tasks.

EXAMPLES
---------
BIRDS: They all can fly, they have two legs. These are some of the shared properties all birds have.
But they all have unique properties of their own eg colour, type, location, what they feed on, etc
Humming Bird - only found in the Americas
Parrots - a tropical bird
Kingfisher - eats fish

So these birds are all instances or objects of the Bird Family(Class)

You can create different objects from a single class.

Say a class is like a group of similar objects under one roof

METHODS AND PROPERTIES
Method is a function, specifically in a class

A property is a variable specifically in a class

examples:
kingfisher.eat()
parrot.speak()
These are methods

parrot.colour = "blue"
sparrow.size = "small"

Properties and methods must be linked to the object in order to work using .
